# Simplepad
A simple Notepad clone for Windows. Created for a college project in 2017, made in Visual Basic and supports Unix line endings!  
Everything included in [v1.0](https://github.com/Erisa/Simplepad/releases/tag/v1.0) was done for the college project, anything after is further enhancements I've made since. I probably won't ever move away from Visual Basic because that would destroy the novelty of the project, I don't mind retargeting to newer .NET versions though.
